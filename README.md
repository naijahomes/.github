NaijaHomes is a modular real estate technology platform built for the Nigerian housing market — connecting renters, landlords, agents, and property managers through a secure marketplace and a powerful private CRM.

We focus on clarity, compliance, and scale.

🚀 What We’re Building

NaijaHomes operates as one platform with two clear portals:

🌍 Public Marketplace

Property discovery and lead generation for renters and buyers.

Browse verified properties

Search by location, price, and features

Save listings

Contact agents or managers

No dashboards. No management tools.

🧠 Private CRM

Operational tools for property management and rent operations.

Property & tenant management

Lease tracking

Rent collection (standard & RentEasy)

Maintenance requests

Agent and landlord dashboards

Compliance-first architecture

🧩 Modular Architecture

Our system is built as independent, toggleable modules:

Core – Authentication, roles, profiles

Marketplace – Public listings & lead generation

CRM – Property, tenant & operations management

Digital Payments – Standard rent collection

RentEasy – Optional rent-financing add-on (partner-led)

This separation ensures:

Risk isolation

Regulatory clarity (CBN-ready)

Faster iteration

Easier scaling across cities

🔐 Governance & Compliance

We take governance seriously.

Role-based access control

Strict marketplace vs CRM separation

No funds custody (partner-led disbursement only)

Audit trails for financial interactions

CBN-aligned architecture decisions
